End-to-end **credit underwriting and binary classification** pipeline for LoanTap's personal loan portfolio.
Transforms raw loan application attributes into a scored underwriting model — performing EDA on 396K+ borrower records, engineering risk flags, building a calibrated Logistic Regression classifier, and surfacing actionable credit decision rules with threshold-tuned Precision–Recall tradeoffs.

## Model Results Summary

### Default Threshold (t = 0.50)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fully Paid | 0.88 | 0.67 | 0.76 | 63,671 |
| Charged Off | 0.31 | 0.63 | 0.42 | 15,535 |
| **Weighted Avg** | **0.77** | **0.66** | **0.69** | **79,206** |

### Scenario A — Balanced (t = 0.52, Best F1)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fully Paid | 0.88 | 0.70 | 0.78 |
| Charged Off | 0.32 | 0.60 | 0.42 |

> Best for **normal market conditions** — maximises loan book size while keeping NPA manageable.

### Scenario B — NPA-Safe (t = 0.41, Recall ≥ 80%)

| Class | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fully Paid | 0.91 | 0.47 | 0.62 |
| Charged Off | 0.27 | 0.80 | 0.40 |

> Best for **economic stress or regulatory pressure** — aggressively catches 80% of all defaulters.

## Feature Engineering Summary

| Engineered Feature | Logic | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `pub_rec_flag` | `pub_rec > 0 → 1` | Presence of any derogatory record matters more than the count |
| `mort_acc_flag` | `mort_acc > 0 → 1` | Having a mortgage signals financial commitment and creditworthiness |
| `pub_rec_bankruptcies_flag` | `pub_rec_bankruptcies > 0 → 1` | Any bankruptcy is a hard negative signal regardless of count |
| `grade` (ordinal) | A=1, B=2, …, G=7 | Preserves natural risk ordering — A is safest, G is riskiest |
| `term` (numeric) | Extract integer from "36 months" | Enables linear relationship modeling |
| `emp_length` (numeric) | `< 1 year`=0, …, `10+ years`=10 | Ordinal mapping preserves employment seniority signal |
| Drop `installment` | Corr = 0.9539 with `loan_amnt` | Eliminates multicollinearity — `loan_amnt` retained |
| State from `address` | Regex extract `[A-Z]{2}` | Enables geographic risk segmentation |

## Key Business Insights

| # | Insight | Business Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Grade is the #1 predictor** — Grade A defaults 6.3% vs Grade G defaults 38% | Grade A/B = fast-track approval; Grade E/F/G = reject or charge significant risk premium |
| 2 | **60-month term doubles default rate** vs 36-month (28% vs 16%) | Prefer 36-month term; require higher income proof for 60-month applications |
| 3 | **DTI > 25 strongly predicts default** | Mandatory additional income verification for DTI > 25 |
| 4 | **`small_business` purpose has highest default rate** across all loan purposes | Apply stricter underwriting criteria for business-purpose loans |
| 5 | **`revol_util` is the top coefficient feature** | Borrowers using > 80% of revolving credit are highest risk — add to rejection triggers |
| 6 | **Teacher and Manager are the safest job titles** (Top 2 by volume) | Stable salaried employees in education/management can be fast-tracked |
| 7 | **Geographic variation: 14% to 27% default rate** across US states | Apply state-level risk adjustment factor in pricing and caps |
| 8 | **80:20 class imbalance** — accuracy metric is misleading | Always evaluate using ROC-AUC and Recall; never use raw accuracy as KPI |

## Questionnaire Answers

| # | Question | Answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | % customers fully paid | **80.39%** |
| Q2 | Correlation: loan_amnt vs installment | **r = 0.9539** — very high positive; higher loan → higher installment |
| Q3 | Majority home ownership | **MORTGAGE** (50.1% of borrowers) |
| Q4 | Grade A fully pays more? | **TRUE** — 93.7% of Grade A borrowers fully pay |
| Q5 | Top 2 job titles | **Teacher** (4,389) and **Manager** (4,250) |
| Q6 | Primary bank metric | **Recall** (catch real defaulters); **ROC-AUC** for overall model selection |
| Q7 | Precision-Recall gap effect | High Recall + Low Precision = good borrowers rejected (lost revenue). High Precision + Low Recall = missed defaulters (NPAs) |
| Q8 | Top features | `grade`, `revol_util`, `annual_inc`, `dti`, `int_rate`, `pub_rec_flag`, `term`, `mort_acc_flag` |
| Q10 | Geographic effect | **YES** — state default rates range from ~14% (IA) to ~27% (NE) |

## Actionable Recommendations

**1. Deploy Three-Tier Credit Engine**
Implement Auto-Approve / Manual Review / Auto-Reject tiers based on model probability scores. Target: 60% auto-approve, 25% manual review, 15% auto-reject to balance speed with risk control.

**2. Grade-Based Risk Pricing**
Set interest rate floors by grade: Grade A = base rate, each grade step adds 150–200bps. This prices NPA risk into the loan economics rather than binary approve/reject decisions.

**3. DTI Hard Cap**
Enforce a DTI ceiling of 35% for all personal loan applications. Applicants above this threshold should be auto-rejected regardless of other positive signals.

**4. Small Business Loan Separation**
Build a dedicated underwriting sub-model for `small_business` purpose loans — they have fundamentally different risk drivers than personal loans and should not share the same scoring model.

**5. State-Level Risk Adjustment**
Encode each state's historical default rate as a feature and apply a state risk multiplier to loan caps. High-default states (NE, NV, SD) should have 10–15% lower maximum approved loan amounts.

**6. Model Monitoring & Retraining**
Retrain the model monthly with new loan outcome data. Set a Recall alert threshold — if Recall for Charged Off drops below 70% in production, trigger an emergency retraining cycle.

**7. Feature Enrichment**
In the next model iteration, add: CIBIL/credit bureau score, employment type (government vs private), city tier (metro vs tier-2), and time-since-last-delinquency. Expected AUC lift: +0.05–0.10.

**8. Graduate to Gradient Boosting**
Logistic Regression (AUC=0.70) is a strong baseline. Upgrade to XGBoost or LightGBM for the production model — these handle non-linear interactions between grade, DTI, and income, typically achieving AUC of 0.76–0.82 on similar portfolios.
